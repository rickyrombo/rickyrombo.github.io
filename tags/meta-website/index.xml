      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been quite a few updates today:
 Added Disqus for commenting (honestly don&amp;rsquo;t expect a whole lot but we&amp;rsquo;ll see!) Added &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo; taxonomy (look, this post has &amp;ldquo;meta-website&amp;rdquo; as a tag!) Updated &amp;ldquo;series&amp;rdquo; taxonomy to have a description and a page to view all series (don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited, there&amp;rsquo;s only one) Ordered the series taxonomy by date ascending, to get chronological order Added date back to the post listing Added a line between post listings and more clear spacing  As well as some bugs fixed:</description>

      <description>As I was starting my new series, I noticed a few things on my website weren&amp;rsquo;t working. I also noticed that my SoundCloud API was old which was likely part of the problem. In the process of fixing things, I decided this would be a good opportunity for me to learn ReactJS and just rebuild my website as a React website.
So I did, and it took me a good chunk of a week.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of moving my website from PHP/MySQL with &lt;a href=&#34;http://laravel.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; to a static site using &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty soon, &lt;a href=&#34;http://rickyrombo.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rickyrombo.com&lt;/a&gt; will point to this GitHub page instead of going to some folder on &lt;a href=&#34;http://awestruckdesign.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AwestruckDesign&lt;/a&gt; or website on &lt;a href=&#34;http://heroku.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.

I&amp;rsquo;ve also been thinking of ways to improve the website. Some things on the list:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
