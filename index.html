	<h3><a title="Introduction to Electro House Music - Intro to EDM" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/electro-house/">Introduction to Electro House Music - Intro to EDM</a></h3>
	<p>Electro house is similar to progressive house, at least the newer, &ldquo;pop&rdquo; version of progressive house that I call mainroom house. It hits harder, is made more for clubs and DJing, and has a lot more synthetic sounds. There&rsquo;s not as much of a &ldquo;layering&rdquo; that happens. Usually all the sounds jump in very quickly or all at once. In my opinion, the best way to decide if a song is electro house or progressive house is to evaluate how &ldquo;human&rdquo; or &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; it sounds. <a title="Introduction to Electro House Music - Intro to EDM" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/electro-house/">...

	<h3><a title="Introduction to Progressive House Music - Intro to EDM" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/progressive-house/">Introduction to Progressive House Music - Intro to EDM</a></h3>
	<p>Progressive house is probably the most popular and most produced form of electronic music outside of the broader genre of dance. Take a look at the massive list of progressive house producers and you&rsquo;ll probably see a lot of names you&rsquo;ll recognize: deadmau5, Zedd, The Chainsmokers, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, and many others. It&rsquo;s my personal favorite subgenre of house.
The &ldquo;drop&rdquo; of progressive house tracks (if applicable) generally emphasizes a melody instead of a percussion or kick. <a title="Introduction to Progressive House Music - Intro to EDM" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/progressive-house/">... Read More</a></p>

	<h3><a title="Introduction to House Music - Intro to EDM" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/house/">Introduction to House Music - Intro to EDM</a></h3>
	<p>House music generally sits at 125-130bpm (usually 128bpm). It&rsquo;s drum pattern is fairly repetitive, with a kick on every quarter note and a snare or clap on every half note (which is optional - not all house music has the snare/clap). The drum pattern is referred to as &ldquo;four on the floor,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve assumed is because it&rsquo;s hitting the kick on each of the four beats per measure in the 4&frasl;4 time signature and the kick pedal and drum sit on the floor in a real drum kit, but I don&rsquo;t know the actual reason. <a title="Introduction to House Music - Intro to EDM" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/house/">...

	<h3><a title="An Introduction to Electronic Dance Music" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/main/">An Introduction to Electronic Dance Music</a></h3>
	<p>So you&rsquo;ve heard your friends talking about EDM, or electronic dance music. Maybe they were going to a music festival like Coachella or Ultra. Maybe they DJ or produce some music. But your friends have shown you different music, and you&rsquo;re confused. What is EDM? Those songs don&rsquo;t sound the same.
Or maybe you&rsquo;re on the opposite side of the spectrum. Perhaps everything does sound the same. One friend says &ldquo;I like dubstep,&rdquo; and your other friend says &ldquo;I like tropical house. <a title="An Introduction to Electronic Dance Music" href="#/posts/intro-to-edm/main/">...

	<h3><a title="A New Home" href="#/posts/new-website/">A New Home</a></h3>
	<p><p>I&rsquo;m currently in the process of moving my website from PHP/MySQL with <a href="http://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel</a> to a static site using <a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. Pretty soon, <a href="http://rickyrombo.com" target="_blank">rickyrombo.com</a> will point to this GitHub page instead of going to some folder on <a href="http://awestruckdesign.com" target="_blank">AwestruckDesign</a> or website on <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.

I&rsquo;ve also been thinking of ways to improve the website. Some things on the list:</p> <a title="A New Home" href="#/posts/new-website/">... Read More</a></p>
