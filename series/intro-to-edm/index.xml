&lt;p&gt;Progressive house is probably the most popular and most produced form of electronic music outside of the generic dance/pop. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_progressive_house_artists&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;massive list of progressive house producers&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;ll probably see a lot of names you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize: deadmau5, Zedd, The Chainsmokers, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, and many others. It&amp;rsquo;s my personal favorite subgenre of house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; of progressive house tracks (if applicable) generally emphasizes a melody instead of a percussion or kick. The genre can be defined by its layers or levels of phrases (a series of &amp;ldquo;bars&amp;rdquo; or essentially a loop pattern) that build up a slow &amp;ldquo;progression&amp;rdquo; into the more energetic &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; phrase (if there is one). Interestingly enough, the &amp;ldquo;progression&amp;rdquo; of the track isn&amp;rsquo;t namesake of the genre. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the history of these genres, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_house#Etymology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;peruse Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; to get a general overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound elements used in progressive house are very melodic. Since it was made popular by deadmau5, many progressive house songs modulate the attack, decay and/or filter of a sawtooth synth to create a plucky sound that will open up into a more full sounding pad as the song progresses, and play large chords on them to make them sound very full and wide. In some songs, especially the newer or more mainstream songs, there might be real instrument sounds. Pianos are a popular element, as are guitars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive house songs are generally extremely long in comparison to your average pop track. They tend to be at least five or six minutes long with excruciatingly long builds and probably less energetic drops than you might expect. I listed some major artists in the first paragraph, and you probably know that their songs aren&amp;rsquo;t like that. They&amp;rsquo;re much quicker and much less slow to build. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/proghouse/comments/19x9yo/guys_please_know_the_difference_between_deep/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;*https://www.reddit.com/r/proghouse/comments/16fi8l/anyone_else_hate_beatports_progressive_house_page/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; around progressive house (as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/22761w/eli5what_the_hell_is_the_difference_between_house/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;almost every subgenre of house&lt;/a&gt;), and what makes it what it is. The larger artists that are releasing those hits with the epic drops and huge beats will be told by music snobs like me that they&amp;rsquo;re not &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; progressive house - they&amp;rsquo;re more like mainroom or pop. There are a lot of smaller, not as well known artists releasing tracks that are more like the &amp;ldquo;real progressive house&amp;rdquo; some of these would expect to see, but since I promised to stick to the more popular artists and song examples I won&amp;rsquo;t be emphasizing them here, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be diving in to some of the more well known tracks that follow the deadmau5 era style of progressive house (with the sawtooth pluck).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;300px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uUVTsY5tXQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uUVTsY5tXQ&#34;&gt;Zedd - Clarity (Tom Budin Remix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This progressive house remix of Zedd&amp;rsquo;s Clarity was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/Zedd/posts/533693530016090&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the winner of the remix competition&lt;/a&gt;. I first discovered it because it was falsely identified as a deadmau5 remix on YouTube. Note how the build is long and &amp;ldquo;progresses&amp;rdquo; without any drums for the first two minutes, and slowly introduces the new sounds. The plucky sawtooth synth (the one that starts as a low sound and opens up - it&amp;rsquo;s introduced at about a minute into the song) is one good way to identify the genre. This song is an incredibly good example of the deadmau5 era style of progressive house.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


        


&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div id=&#34;sound-1.33631864e&amp;#43;08&#34; class=&#34;sound&#34;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;full-art&#34;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&#34;play-hover-overlay&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;play-overlay-sound-133631864&#34; class=&#34;fa fa-play&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;a onclick=&#34;window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(&#39;sound-clicked&#39;, {detail:  133631864  })); return false&#34; data-id=&#34;133631864&#34; class=&#34;sound-link full-art&#34; href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/allmau5/deadmau5-all-i-have&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000070225334-ftwp91-t500x500.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play deadmau5- All I Have&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/allmau5/deadmau5-all-i-have&#34;&gt;deadmau5- All I Have&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It took a bit of searching but I found an upload of &amp;ldquo;All I Have&amp;rdquo; by deadmau5 somewhere on SoundCloud. Notice how similar the plucky synth is to the one in Tom Budin&amp;rsquo;s remix of Clarity above. Deadmau5 also doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring the kick in until a few phrases have passed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a4tGghJ2euPeI7HvpkNi1CU&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play deadmau5 - I Remember&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4tGghJ2euPeI7HvpkNi1CU&#34;&gt;deadmau5 - I Remember&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Remember_(deadmau5_and_Kaskade_song)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;classified by Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; as electro house, I would argue that it&amp;rsquo;s more progressive (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beatport.com/track/i-remember-vocal-mix/870142&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beatport agrees&lt;/a&gt;. The plucks give it away, as does the repetition and building. Also note the sections that the beat drops out, and the song has to build its way back up in the phrasing emphasized earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a2zZfag7OeUmyIdaEmfEJed&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play Eric Prydz - Illusions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2zZfag7OeUmyIdaEmfEJed&#34;&gt;Eric Prydz - Illusions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eric Prydz and deadmau5 are leaders of this sawtooth synth style of progressive house sound. Note the similarities of flow and characteristics of the song structure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a4GhRCSt1NJIK0osyhRS0H8&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play Eric Prydz - Allein&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4GhRCSt1NJIK0osyhRS0H8&#34;&gt;Eric Prydz - Allein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note the repetitions and the phrasing behind adding elements. Feel the way the song builds up over time and seems to be constantly &amp;ldquo;progressing&amp;rdquo; towards something. The addition of different sounds is pretty easy to hear and happens gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a4xTIknzHtjrqRQ1hlL2T8W&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play Swedish House Mafia - Save the World&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/4xTIknzHtjrqRQ1hlL2T8W&#34;&gt;Swedish House Mafia - Save the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I miss Swedish House Mafia. Songs like this are the reason I fell in love with EDM. Again, listen to the repetitions and the adding of different sounds and elements. This one probably has the most energetic drop of those I&amp;rsquo;ve inroduced so far, and is probably the most danceable. You might have noticed the trend, as I&amp;rsquo;ve carefully selected each song to be getting closer and closer to what today&amp;rsquo;s progressive house sounds like.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;300px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OsJSwGc4lsA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsJSwGc4lsA&#34;&gt;Reflekt - Need to Feel Loved (Adam K &amp;amp; Soha Remix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Adam K &amp;amp; Soha have some stellar progressive house style remixes. You can hear the plucking sawtooth synth, but they&amp;rsquo;ve added strings to give it a more human instrument (the vocals help that too). The sound is very melodic, and there are definitely layers of sounds being added and removed, with the main loops staying very similar.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;300px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Za02ZYn9190&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za02ZYn9190&#34;&gt;Benny Bennasi - Come Fly Away (Adam K &amp;amp; Soha Remix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s basically just the vocals on top of a beautiful sawtooth pluck with the exact filter/decay automation that I talked about earlier, a silky bassline, and drums, but yet it sounds so full. Notice that it&amp;rsquo;s also got the huge introduction and is also six and a half minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;300px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwpj9UANXo4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwpj9UANXo4&#34;&gt;Kaskade - 4AM (Adam K &amp;amp; Soha Remix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet another Adam K &amp;amp; Soha remix - I promise this will be my last one. These three songs have a lot in common, and if you like the plucky deadmau5 style sawtooth synth style of progressive house, then Adam K &amp;amp; Soha are your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-what-you-expected&#34;&gt;Not what you expected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now introduce you to &amp;ldquo;mainroom house.&amp;rdquo; Progressive house now gets used as a catch-all for mainroom house, which are songs you might hear in the mainroom of a club. The drops become the core of the song, and the kick comes out stronger in the mix. There&amp;rsquo;s generally a higher energy experience, and the songs feel more danceable. The songs become structured much more like pop songs - they become shorter, more often include lyrics, and have quicker builds and less of the &amp;ldquo;pluck&amp;rdquo; sound. These tend to be very hard to distinguish from other subgenres such as electro house, big room house, and the general pop/dance.&lt;/p&gt;


        


&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;div id=&#34;sound-2.05140598e&amp;#43;08&#34; class=&#34;sound&#34;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&#34;full-art&#34;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&#34;play-hover-overlay&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;play-overlay-sound-205140598&#34; class=&#34;fa fa-play&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;a onclick=&#34;window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(&#39;sound-clicked&#39;, {detail:  205140598  })); return false&#34; data-id=&#34;205140598&#34; class=&#34;sound-link full-art&#34; href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/stevejamesofficial/the-chainsmokers-let-you-go-steve-james-remix&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000131898993-eojh3n-t500x500.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play The Chainsmokers - Let You Go (Steve James Remix)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/stevejamesofficial/the-chainsmokers-let-you-go-steve-james-remix&#34;&gt;The Chainsmokers - Let You Go (Steve James Remix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Steve James would still fall into the progressive house category even though his tracks sound almost nothing like deadmau5 or the Tom Budin remix above. The original song by The Chainsmokers could also be described as progressive house. The drop includes the same synth melody but with a heavier kick and some open sawtooth synths for that higher energy. Note the way the build goes up until everything &amp;ldquo;drops&amp;rdquo; away and you&amp;rsquo;re left with only the vocal for a beat before the drop kicks in. That style of drop will be very common for this subgenre.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a05dL7chWJaVjMJnGO1YCKk&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play Tritonal, Cash Cash - Untouchable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/05dL7chWJaVjMJnGO1YCKk&#34;&gt;Tritonal, Cash Cash - Untouchable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tritonal and Cash Cash are both mostly progressive house producers. They&amp;rsquo;re also fairly well known names. Listen to the lead synth - that sort of lead tends to appear in progressive house songs. Also, notice the piano backing the song throughout. This mainroom style of progressive house tries to reach some familiarity with the listeners by using pianos or guitars or other common instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play Echosmith - Cool Kids (Gazzo &amp;amp; Two Friends Remix)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://soundcloud.com/two-friends/echosmith-cool-kids-gazzo-two-friends-remix-2&#34;&gt;Echosmith - Cool Kids (Gazzo &amp;amp; Two Friends Remix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two Friends (back when they were &amp;ldquo;The Two Friends&amp;rdquo;) were known for their progressive house. Take a look at a couple other Two Friends songs for more examples of progressive house&amp;rsquo;s new sound: &amp;ldquo;Long Way Home&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Our Name In Lights&amp;rdquo; are more quintessential progressive house. These days, Two Friends have moved on to a different style of sound that they&amp;rsquo;ve called soul house, as well as some more future sounding tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Another Two Friends remix, this time of RAC. Notice how late the drop comes and the emphasis on the melody and music over percussion and weird sounding sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Elephante has &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/iamtheelephante/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tons of remixes&lt;/a&gt; (and is now releasing &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/iamtheelephante/sets/i-am-the-elephante&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;his debut EP&lt;/a&gt;) and most of them are progressive house (although perhaps some could be considered electro house). By this point you should be able to hear the synth sounds sounding fairly familiar. Progressive house tends to build up with the same synth it &amp;ldquo;drops&amp;rdquo; with, and the &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; is simply more aggressive and with a bigger backing ensemble. The main synth in many Elephante songs sounds &amp;ldquo;buzzy,&amp;rdquo; which is a.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a4f13AaRyukUTWleyKXaRDh&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I absolutely love every one of Mako&amp;rsquo;s songs. They are the epitome of emotion-filled electronic music. This song is sure to draw out good feels and give your heart warmth. While you enjoy it, notice the emphasis on guitar and piano elements and the relaxed synth sounds. Also notice how the structure is almost identical to a general pop song - there&amp;rsquo;s just a larger emphasis on the build/chorus structures (and the chorus and drop are played separately).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This Elephante remix of the above song hits a little bit harder. It takes a lot of the electro house elements I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about in the next section and applies them to a progressive house song. Notice the guitar and piano sounds are less emphasized and more synthetic/electronic sounds are added. This is one of the harder to place songs as it could easily be considered electro house.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-3&#34;&gt;
        &lt;iframe class=&#34;spotify-play-button&#34; src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3atrack%3a2ISSQPb9LHHiV6ng2NXosL&#34; width=&#34;720&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;col-md-9&#34;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Play Zedd - Beautiful Now (ft. Jon Bellion)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2ISSQPb9LHHiV6ng2NXosL&#34;&gt;Zedd - Beautiful Now (ft. Jon Bellion)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now this song is definitely the most &amp;ldquo;pop.&amp;rdquo; In fact, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; pop. This song is 100% pop (by definition, of being popular - and also by structure and the vocal &amp;ldquo;nah nah&amp;rdquo; in the chorus (in this case &amp;ldquo;bah bah&amp;rdquo;)) and yet it&amp;rsquo;s also still possible to describe it as progressive house. The you can totally hear the contrast between this example and the first two examples.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be clear from those two sets of examples that there&amp;rsquo;s two different styles of progressive house (or two eras, depending on how you look at it). The latter style of progressive house is quicker, more exciting, and heavier on the drum pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One main reason for this is for live shows. The original progressive house genre was too difficult or too niche for a general live audience. It took too long to build and the audience would lose interest. DJs could try to mix just the drop into their performance (if it had one), but the reality is that without the build, the drops of original progressive house didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same impact. Producers and DJs wanted their listeners to dance (and obviously to also reach more listeners), and so the genre adapted and pivoted closer to a pop structure. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to what happened with country music and rock music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two styles of progressive house are so different, they&amp;rsquo;ve actually warranted two completely different subreddits on reddit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/proghouse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;r/proghouse&lt;/a&gt; for both styles and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/RealProgHouse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;r/RealProgHouse&lt;/a&gt; for the original &amp;ldquo;purer&amp;rdquo; style. The latter points you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://thedancemusicguide.com/progressive-house&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Dance Music Guide Progressive House&lt;/a&gt; article to help you figure out the difference. The article claims what I called &amp;ldquo;mainroom&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;bigroom&amp;rdquo; (you can see that they are referring to the same room). I chose the term mainroom specifically because I think bigroom is reserved for the even heavier, harder, festival style mixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps you define progressive house and determine if a song is progressive house in the future. As you try to understand and categorize music, it&amp;rsquo;s important you realize tracks might not be clear cut. I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned how some songs crossover between electro house and progressive house, but even more &amp;ldquo;genre-breakers&amp;rdquo; are going to pop up as we cover more genres subgenres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just a friendly reminder, it&amp;rsquo;s better to fudge the lines on what subgenre a song is than get into a debate. Not only do debates over what these subgenres are tend to be fruitless and lengthy, but there&amp;rsquo;s no reason you can&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s both or a crossover. Genres are used to help find similar songs or to describe a style of music. That&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;classic country&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;pop country&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;country rock&amp;rdquo; - they share common country elements but have different influences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to House Music - Intro to EDM</title>
      <link>http://rickyrombo.com/posts/intro-to-edm/house/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2017 00:09:22 -0600</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;House music generally sits at 125-130bpm (usually 128bpm). It&amp;rsquo;s drum pattern is fairly repetitive, with a kick on every quarter note and a snare or clap on every half note (which is optional - not all house music has the snare/clap). The drum pattern is referred to as &amp;ldquo;four on the floor,&amp;rdquo; which I&amp;rsquo;ve assumed is because it&amp;rsquo;s hitting the kick on each of the four beats per measure in the &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; time signature and the kick pedal and drum sit on the floor in a real drum kit, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the actual reason. In any case, the pattern is a kick every quarter note in a &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; time signature, for all the people with music theory backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large amount of pop songs you hear on the radio or in clubs could be considered house music (generally speaking). Almost everything by Calvin Harris, deadmau5, Zedd, and David Guetta is house music (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_house_music_artists&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;all these people&lt;/a&gt; are house artists). I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep my examples to some of my favorite fairly popular songs or favorite remixes of popular songs, but the focus is on songs that illustrate some core concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within house music, there are more subgenres based on the energy and the bassline. My next few posts will go into each subgenre in detail, starting with &amp;ldquo;progressive house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you should read up on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music#Origins_.281980s.29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;origin of house&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Introduction to Electronic Dance Music</title>
      <link>http://rickyrombo.com/posts/intro-to-edm/main/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve heard your friends talking about EDM, or electronic dance music. Maybe they were going to a music festival like Coachella or Ultra. Maybe they DJ or produce some music. But your friends have shown you different music, and you&amp;rsquo;re confused. What is EDM? Those songs don&amp;rsquo;t sound the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re on the opposite side of the spectrum. Perhaps everything &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; sound the same. One friend says &amp;ldquo;I like dubstep,&amp;rdquo; and your other friend says &amp;ldquo;I like tropical house.&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;re stuck thinking, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re somewhere in the middle, and you know and appreciate the different subgenres of EDM. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re here because you want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l-PjIqPOBw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;go one deeper&lt;/a&gt; on each subgenre and really understand the what makes them unique. Or maybe you just want to hear what I think are the different genres and criticize my examples. Got a better example? Reach out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, you&amp;rsquo;re here. Welcome to the series. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through an analysis of a few major genres as of 2016, and include some favorite examples of mine throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-you-tell-what-genre-songs-are&#34;&gt;How do you tell what genre songs are?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subgenres in EDM are primarily distinguishable from BPM (beats per minute) and drum pattern. Since everything is made electronically (at least mostly electronically) it&amp;rsquo;s easy to establish a rigid BPM. And since it&amp;rsquo;s made for dancing, having most of the dance music at the same speed helps DJs mix from one track to the next. Also, the BPM of a song and the drum pattern are the key factors in determining the energy and the style of dance, which are two of the main factors in what makes a genre in any form of music. Artists and different music providers will generally tell you what genre a song is, but most of the time EDM is listed as &amp;ldquo;Electronic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-a-drop&#34;&gt;What is a &amp;ldquo;drop?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; is the part of the song that follows the end of the main build. The meaning is fairly ambiguous. The best analogy would be an amusement ride such as a drop tower or roller coaster. Just as the cart climbs to the top, the song builds to the climax of suspense. Immediately following is the &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; - your stomach drops on the roller coaster, your feet leave the floor on the dance floor. The reason it&amp;rsquo;s ambiguous is that some people view the last measure of the build as the drop - think of it as the pause in the roller coaster as you hang over the edge of the first hill. Others view the whole energetic phrase as the drop (like me), which would correspond to the entire ride down the first hill in a roller coaster as opposed to the transition from climbing to falling. All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s around the transition of the song from building to a high energy phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;do-all-edm-songs-have-a-drop&#34;&gt;Do all EDM songs have a drop?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly, no. But technically the concept is still there even if a song doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo;-like chorus or even if a song isn&amp;rsquo;t EDM. A song may not have a drop if its build (if any) isn&amp;rsquo;t substantially different from its chorus phrase in terms of energy. For instance, it would be weird to say that tropical house has a &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; because the change of energy isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as drastic as other genres, although theoretically you could. A &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; is a moment of hype - if you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find yourself waiting in anticipation to jump up and down on the dance floor you&amp;rsquo;re pretty safe not calling it a &amp;ldquo;drop.&amp;rdquo; However, if someone else calls it a drop, don&amp;rsquo;t be that guy that tries to correct them. &lt;a href=&#34;http://theoatmeal.com/comics/irony&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot like irony&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not something worth debating - you will know what part of the song is the &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; even if it&amp;rsquo;s weird or feels wrong to call it that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;let-s-get-started&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start our exploration with house music. That will cover most everything you&amp;rsquo;ll hear on the radio and in clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
